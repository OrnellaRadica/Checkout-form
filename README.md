## About the proyect

Project created by **Ornella Radica** developed with React.

I decided to make the project with Next.js to deploy on Vercel and have a url where anyone can access and view the project.

I used the Formik library to develop the form, and Yup for the validations, because it makes it easy to mantain and it's widely supported by the community.

I also used the Tailwind CSS and classnames libraries, to style the website.
